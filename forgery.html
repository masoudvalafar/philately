                It is with a great pain that I have to confess that Iranian philately is plagued with forgeries.
                The abundance of forgeries has caused a lot of problems for collectors as not only it wastes a
                lot of their resources (both money and time) but also it is extremely disappointing for them
                when they realize their precious collection is also infected with the same plague, to the extent that
                many have given up collecting altogether.
                What makes things worse is that there are not that many resources available to collectors to educate
                them about these forgeries.<br>
                Over the years, some experts avoided sharing their knowledge publicly as they were afraid this
                information will mainly help forgers improve their forgeries and will only make the problem worse. I am
                fundamentally against this belief. I belive the only way to fight the plague of forgery is by equiping
                every collector with the knowledge to detect forgeries. That is one of main goals of creating this
                website in the first place. As such, in this page, I will share some examples of forgeries I have seen
                so that everyone is able to detect such forgeries when they see them.<br>
                A couple of very important notes:<br>
                1- Detecting forgeries is an evolving science as forgers come up with new ways to make their product
                similar to the real ones. As such, what I share below is not a complete and bullet-proof process for
                detecting forgeries. It is just the very basic to get started.
                2- The safest and most reliable way to ensure whether an item is genuine is to ask for a certificate
                from an expert. While
                experts may inadvertantly make mistakes, they are equiped with the best tools and techniques to tell a
                genuine item apart from the forgeries. For Iranian items, <a href="https://persi.com/">Mr Sadri</a> and
                <a href="https://iranphilately.org/">Iran Philatelic Study Circle (IPSC)</a> issue trustable
                certificate.<br>
            </p> -->
            <p>
                It is with deep regret that I must acknowledge the prevalence of forgeries in Iranian philately. This
                abundance of
                counterfeit items poses significant challenges for collectors, wasting their valuable resources—both
                time and money—and
                leading to the disheartening realization that their cherished collections may also be tainted by these
                forgeries. This
                issue has driven many enthusiasts to abandon their pursuit of philately altogether. <br>

                Exacerbating the problem is the lack of accessible resources to educate collectors about these
                forgeries. Historically,
                some experts have been reluctant to share their knowledge publicly, fearing that such information would
                aid forgers in
                improving their techniques, thus worsening the problem. I fundamentally oppose this viewpoint. I
                believe that the most
                effective way to combat the plague of forgery is to equip every collector with as much knowledge as
                possible to identify
                counterfeits.
                This is one of the primary objectives of this website. On this page, I will share examples of forgeries
                I have
                encountered, enabling everyone to recognize these counterfeits.<br>

                A couple of very important notes:<br>

                1- Detecting forgeries is an evolving science, as forgers continually develop new methods to make their
                products resemble
                genuine items. Therefore, the information shared here is not a complete and foolproof guide but a simply
                a mere
                starting point.<br>
                2- The safest and most reliable way to verify the authenticity of an item is to seek a certificate from
                an
                expert. While
                experts may occasionally make mistakes, they possess the best tools and techniques to distinguish
                genuine items from
                forgeries. For Iranian items, <a href="https://persi.com/">Mr Sadri</a> and
                <a href="https://iranphilately.org/">Iran Philatelic Study Circle (IPSC)</a> issue trustworthy
                certificates.
