                <h4>The Challenge of Counterfeit Items</h4>
                <p>
                    It is with great concern that we must address the significant issue of forgeries within Iranian
                    philately. The prevalence of counterfeit items presents substantial challenges for collectors, often
                    resulting in:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wasted time and financial resources</li>
                    <li>Compromised integrity of collections</li>
                    <li>Disillusionment among enthusiasts, sometimes leading to their departure from the field
                        altogether
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>The Need for Education</h4>
                <p>
                    A critical factor exacerbating this issue has been the historical scarcity of accessible resources
                    to
                    educate collectors
                    about these forgeries. Some experts have previously been hesitant to share their knowledge publicly,
                    fearing that such
                    information might inadvertently assist forgers in refining their techniques.
                </p>

                <h4>Our Approach: Knowledge as Power</h4>
                <p>
                    We fundamentally oppose the notion of withholding information. Our stance is clear: the most
                    effective
                    strategy to
                    combat forgery is to empower every collector with comprehensive knowledge to identify counterfeits.
                    This
                    principle forms
                    one of the primary objectives of our website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this page, we will provide examples of forgeries we have encountered, enabling collectors to
                    recognize
                    these counterfeits more easily.
                </p>

                <h4>Important Considerations</h4>
                <p>1- Evolving Techniques: Detecting forgeries is a dynamic field. Forgers continually develop new
                    methods to enhance the authenticity of their products. Therefore, the information shared here should
                    be considered a starting point rather than an exhaustive guide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2- Expert Verification: The most reliable method to authenticate an item is to obtain a certificate
                    from a recognized expert. While experts may occasionally make mistakes, they possess the most
                    advanced tools and techniques to distinguish genuine items from forgeries. For Iranian items, we
                    recommend seeking certificates from:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://persi.com/">Mr Sadri</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://iranphilately.org/">Iran Philatelic Study Circle (IPSC)</a></li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    By fostering an open dialogue and sharing knowledge, we aim to preserve the integrity and joy of
                    Iranian philately for current and future generations of collectors.

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">A Brief List of Guidelines for Authenticating Covers</button>
            <div class="content" id="cover-forged-content">
                <p>
                    When examining covers for authenticity, consider the following key points:
                </p>
                <h4>Date Consistency</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quite often, senders wrote the date on covers. These dates should either be the same as or
                        slightly precede the cancellation postmark date.
                    </li>
                    <li>Ensure the dates on both the cover and the cancellation align with: a) The stamp's issue date,
                        b) The period during which the stamp was valid for postage
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <h4>Regional Usage</h4>
                <p>
                    For stamps restricted to specific regions confirm that the cancellation postmark matches the
                    authorized regions for that stamp.
                </p>

                <h4>Stamp Authenticity</h4>
                <p>
                    Verify the authenticity of the stamp. If the stamp features an overprint, authenticate the
                    overprint's validity.
                </p>

                <h4>Postmark Authenticity</h4>
                <p>
                    Thoroughly examine cancellations to ensure their validity:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a reputable cancellation catalog to verify that the postmark on the cover is listed and
                        matches the characteristics described.</li>
                    <li>Be cautious of covers where the majority of the cancellation is on the stamp, with only a small
                        portion visible on the cover itself.</li>
                    <li>Check for absence of cancellation marks under the stamp on the cover. Be wary of stamps that
                        appear tightly adhered to the cover on all sides.</li>
                    <li>Confirm that the texture and color of the postmark are consistent across both the stamp and the
                        cover.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>Postage Rate Verification</h4>
                <p>Be mindful of the postage rate applied to the cover and ensure it aligns with the historical rates
                    for:
                    a) The type of mail (e.g., letter, postcard, parcel)
                    b) The destination (domestic or international)
                    c) Any additional services (e.g., registration)<br>

                        </script>
                        <p>Upon careful examination, this cover exhibits characteristics of a well-crafted forgery.
                            Despite its convincing
                            appearance, there are critical discrepancies that reveal its inauthentic nature:</p>
                        <p>i) The cancellation postmark is dated 17/11/1910. However, the stamps affixed to the cover
                            were not issued until 1925. The stamps in question were in circulation only during 1925 and
                            1926. This glaring anachronism—where the postmark predates the stamps by approximately 15
                            years—is a definitive indicator of forgery.</p>
                        <p>ii) The manuscript date written by the sender on the letter reads "12th of Zi-Alhaje" in the
                            Lunar Hegira calendar. In contrast, the cancellation postmark date (17/11/1910) is
                            equivalent to the "14th of Zi-Alghade" in the Lunar Hegira
                            calendar.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <script>
                            addItem(items["forge-2"], 'forgery-example-list');
                        </script>
                        <p>
                            This letter was sent from Nehavand to Tehran on Sunday, 7th of Zi-Alqade, 1335 (Lunar
                            calendar) / August 25, 1917
                            (Gregorian), from Nehavand. The cancellation postmark shows August 26, 1917 as when the
                            letter was sent and October 5, 1917 when it arrived in Tehran. The extended transit time (41
                            days) is not unusual, considering it occurred during World War I.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Stamp usage: The stamps used is 3ch Ahmad Shah Portrait issue of 1911 with "officiel"
                            handstamp. The issue is that these stamps were only in circulation from late 1911 to 1912
                            and the 1917 postage date is significantly later than the stamps' circulation
                            period.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Geographical Inconsistency: Ahmad Shah Portrait issue of 1911 with "officiel" were
                            exclusively used in Azerbaijan province,
                            specifically in Tauris (Tabriz), Oroumieh, Djoulfa, Savojbolagh, and Khoy. However, this
                            letter originates from Nehavand, which is not in the Azerbaijan
                            province.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Handstamp Authenticity: Upon a closer inspection, the "officiel" handstamps on the stamps
                            show significant
                            differences from genuine examples as well.</p>
                        <p>
                            The combination of these factors — temporal inconsistency, geographic discrepancy, and
                            questionable handstamps — strongly indicates that this cover is counterfeit.
