            <p>Welcome to my website dedicated to Iran Postal History! My name is Masoud Valafar and my main focus is on
                the Iran postal history from 1909 to 1925, when Ahmad
                Shah was in power. Iran, known as Persia at the time, was experiencing one of its most chaotic time in
                its history and this chaos is in turn reflected in the postal service at the time.</p>

            <p>This website is organized as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    On the <a href="./education.html">Education</a> page, you can find general information about
                    the letters and postal markings of that era.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the <a href="./rate.html">Rate</a> page, I have listed all the information about the rate of
                    postal items.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the <a href="./collection.html">Collection</a> page I am exhibiting some of the interesting items
                    I have in my collection.
                </li>
                <li>On the <a href="./resources.html">Resources</a> page, I have listed all the relevant resources I
                    have found.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>This website is an ongoing research project to become an exhustive source
                for the postal history of that era. It is by no means anywhere close to being complete or will ever be.
