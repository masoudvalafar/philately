            <h3>Varieties, Errors, and more!</h3>

            <p>In this page I am only discussing stamps. Before starting the topic of errors and verities, I want to
                classify items into the following groups:
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on whether the stamps created by the postal service authorities were used in the postal service
                or not we have two types of stamps:
                - issued: were used in the postal service
                - unissued: were created to be used in the postal service

                Forgeries: Any stamp that is not created by postal authorities.

                Sometimes, a subset of stamps looked different from what it should look like. If the difference was
                acceptable by
                the postal authorities, it is called a "variety". If the difference was considered unacceptable and the
                authorities tried to prevent the stamp with such flaw to go into circulation, it is considered an
                "error". The three main characteristics of errors:
                - consistent: the difference appears on every stamp that went through the same process that caused it.
                - major: the difference should significantly impact the appearence of the stamp
                - unintentional: the difference should not be created by the postal authorities on purpose.


                There is a groupf of stamps that are created by or with collaboration from the postal authorities for
                collectors. If these stamps were supported by Iran Postal Service then these items should be considered
                philatelic stamps. If they are created by a postal authority for personal benefits, they should be
                considered forgeries.
