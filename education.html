                    Miskal was 6ch for the whole era except a short period in 1921. Most covers fall into this weight
                    class and have 6ch rate (more on rates <a href="./rate.html">here</a>).

                <p>The Ahmad Shah portrait issue of 1911 was in use from 1911 until 1920. As such, the combination of
                    the rate and the stamp used make the cover demonstrated below a very typical cover of this era.</p>

                <p>On the front of the cover, you can usually find the name of the destination city and the name of the
                    receiver. Usually, the date is also included in Hegira calendar as it was the most popular
                    among common people due to its religious significance.</p>
